# VRChatSpotifyControler

Media controller for Spotify using VRChat OSC  
Supports now playing text using VRChat chatbox

## Usage

#### Now Playing Chatbox

To use just the now playing chatbox, you only need to run the program while Spotify and VRChat are open.  
To stop the now playing chatbox just close the program.

#### Media Controls

Adding the Media controls to your models allows you to control Spotify and also toggle the now playing chatbox, without closing the program.  

In Unity set your avatar up with avatar 3.0 parameters:

  pause-play : bool  
  next-track : bool  
  previous-track : bool  
  vol-slider : float  
  now-playing : bool  

The names of the parameters must match exactly.

Add 4 buttons and one radical puppet to your avatar 3.0 menu, and assign the paramaters as shown
